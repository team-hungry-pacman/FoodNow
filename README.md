# FoodNow
 FoodNow is a mobile responsive website designed to help users find food fast based on their current location and time, 
saving time from blindly searching for places to eat at any time of the day.

FoodNow is a project stemmed from SOTAKL Hackfest 2016, built by 4 aspiring developers and 1 designer forming
Team Hungry-Pacman. 

Here, it is being further developed and redesigned.

Currently under development:
- Cleaning up code
- Substituted cap (instead of showing PacMan all day! If it shows Pac-Man all day = out of reach)
- New designs
- Creating a filter for user to sort by price, ratings, distance, type of restaurant, closing soon
- Google request timer
- 'Show Me More' button 
- Radius cap

Fixes:
- Date set to current date and time
- Nearest distance locations fixed
